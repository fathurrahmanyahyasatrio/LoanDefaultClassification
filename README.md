# Loan Default Classification

This repository is to introduce classification process on Loan Default Dataset (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_4t4Qcyct4SznvZ3EBpP8wKlPdul__Hf/view?usp=sharing). Banks heavily rely on lending loans. But it is often associated with risk. The borrower's may default on the loan. To mitigate this issue, the banks have decided to use Machine Learning to overcome this issue. They have collected past data on the loan borrowers and would like you to develop a strong Machine Learning Model to classify if any borrower is likely to default or not. 

The dataset is enormous and consists of multiple factors like borrower's income, gender, loan purpose etc. The dataset is subject to strong multicollinearity and empty values. 

# Objective

We aim to identify any flaws or issues in the data by carefully examining the ataset, we'll be able to find and address any incosistencies or errors, ensuring that our analysis is based on reliable and accurate data. Once the data is cleaned and validated, the next step is data analysis. This involves exploring the dataset , looking for patterns, trends, and relationship that can provide valuable insights. By understanding the data better, we can make informed decisions and uncover important findings. Finally, our objective is to build the best possible prediction model using Decision Tree and Random Forest.
